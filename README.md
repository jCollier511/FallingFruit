# FallingFruit

This project can be found at this link: https://people.rit.edu/jdc8127/330/project-2-final-2/home.html 

This is a simple game that uses PoseNet to track and identify someone's face. By moving their head the player can catch the fruit falling from the sky in their basket. I also used web components to create a coherent theme across the web pages.
